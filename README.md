# Description

A password generator that has flexible parameters for user preference.

# Installation

No user installation required, simply navigate to the URL in your preferred browser.

# Usage

Upon clicking the red button that says "Generate Password", the user will be prompted to select a length for their password by entering a number between 8 and 128. Once confirmed, the user will be able to select whether they want symbols, numbers, uppercase, or lowercase letters. Once all parameters have been decided, the user will be able to confirm one last time, or change their mind and go back if they made a mistake. Once confirmed, the password will be generated, and the parameters, possible characters, and generated password are logged to the console.
